INSTALLATION
==============================
Supposed you install the application into the directory
    C:\IIS\PhpNuget    
Reachable with the address
    http://foo.com/my/phpnuget
    
* Create the "C:\IIS\PhpNuget\db" folder assigning write/modify rights to its content.    
* Create the "C:\IIS\PhpNuget\sources" folder assigning write/modify rights to its content
* Add, if not present, the upload_tmp_dir in php.ini and set it to the location that 
  will be used as temporary place for uploads
* Navigate on 
    http://foo.com/my/phpnuget/setup.php 
  and compile at least the password and username fields
* Delete, or rename the file C:\IIS\PhpNuget\setup.php
* Apache: If you use an apache web server remember to change the file
    C:\IIS\PhpNuget\.htaccess 
  modifying the: "web/phpnuget" with your root. 
  For our example we will change the "web/phpnuget" in .htaccess with: "my/phpnuget"
* IIS: If you run it on windows download the windowsextra.zip for the support of UrlRewrite 
  in windows and change accordingly the web.config
  

Note that the db and source location depends from the C:\IIS\PhpNuget\settings.php file. A good 
behaviour would be placing these folders -outside- the web-accessible zones!!
